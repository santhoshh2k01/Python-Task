Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the Intel Image Classification dataset, which consists of natural scenes around the world categorized into six classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.
